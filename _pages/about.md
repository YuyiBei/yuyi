Hi! I'm Yuyi Bei. I am from Hangzhou, China. My mbti is ENFJ. I am not a thoughtfully fluent person but I see myself as a deep-thinker, or an always-supprises-straingers-with-her-three-minutes-long-talk-with-nothingness-but-always-forget-detail-things-and-thus-kills-academic-meetings-with-dead-silence-because-some-spontanious-things-would-jump-up-to-her-seemingly-innocent-however-actively-functioning-brain-with-only-few-modern-information meditator, and I always try hard to understand those whatever-comes-to-mind-they-would-have-a-ton-to-relate-to-their-own-realistic-stories people's logic. I have a highly organized brain that does allow any overly-complex or -detialed information to stay. I love observing nature and wild animals. They are my favorites.
